## Heart Disease Predictor

Welcome to the Heart Disease Predictor project! ü©∫‚ù§Ô∏è This endeavor combines Machine Learning, Python, SQL, and Flask to create a predictive tool for assessing heart disease risks and promoting early precautions.

Using the Random Forest Algorithm, I've developed an accurate predictive model by analyzing historical heart patient data. This model empowers users to evaluate their potential heart disease risks, aiding in timely preventive measures.

Key Skills Utilized:
- **Machine Learning:** Employed the Random Forest Algorithm for accurate predictions.
- **Python:** Developed the model, analysis, and user interface.
- **SQL:** Managed and queried the dataset efficiently.
- **Flask:** Created an interactive user interface for input and predictions.

The project's impact includes:
- **Early Detection:** Users can identify potential heart disease risks and take proactive steps.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Exploratory data analysis revealed crucial risk factors.
- **User-Friendly:** Flask-based interface simplifies health data input and prediction retrieval.
